                <em style="color: coral;"> Luxury Industry</em><br>
                In economics, a luxury good (or upmarket good) is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally as income rises, so that expenditures on the good become a greater proportion of overall spending. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_goods) Historically,  Wild animal products were wildly used in the producing of luxury goods. The scarcity of wildlife caused the high value and iconic meaning of showing high social status in many cultures. However, the awareness of animal protection has raised yearly. More and more brands begin to say NO to wild animal products such as furs.

                <em style="color: coral;">Wildlife Trade</em><br>
                All over the world, wild animals are suffering painfully because of the animal products trade. The trade in endangered animals whether elephant ivory, rhino horn or animals captured as exotic pets – is a growing threat pushing thousands of species to the brink of extinction. As a student and a consumer, we noticed that the connection between wildlife products consuming and luxury industry. The skins, feather, furs using in the glamorous coats, jackets, shoes, were all once part of animal bodies. The cruelty behind these is entirely about greed.

            Since the dawn of time, 619 million people have died in wars, and the same number of animals are killed every three days.
             <br> <br>
            Every year, the global leather industry alone kills more than a billion animals.

Apart from the purpose of learning website building skills, this website intends to analyze the wildlife trade from the dataset of CITES in the period of 2012-2018. <br> Through presenting the truth we hope to reveal the Inseparable relationship between luxury industry and wildlife trade，  then recall people’s awareness of protecting wildlife by consuming less luxury goods made from wild animals.
