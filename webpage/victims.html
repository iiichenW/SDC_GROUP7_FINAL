Followed is Europe, whose trading frequency is as two-thirds much as Asia. However, the Africa, Oceania and South America wildlife accounts for little.

Same as the importer analysis, the Africa, Oceania and South America also exported few compared with other continents. The trend of Europe, Asia and North America’s trade had an evident interannual fluctuation.</p>

                This diagram shows the difference of concentration of the origins of wildlife products by continents, which seems like have a similar ranking all these years. North America stayed on top consistently, which reached the peak of 6166 in 2013, while Europe was on the opposite. Furthermore, we could figure out the amount of exporting trades fluctuated down yearly.

Apart from the purpose of learning website building skills, this website intends to analyze the wildlife trade from the dataset of CITES in the period of 2012-2018. <br> Through presenting the truth we hope to reveal the Inseparable relationship between luxury industry and wildlife trade，  then recall people’s awareness of protecting wildlife by consuming less luxury goods made from wild animals.
