The reticulated python is a snake species in the family Pythonidae native to South and Southeast Asia. It is the world's longest snake and listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List because of its wide distribution. In several range countries, it is hunted for its skin, for use in traditional medicine, and for sale as a pet.

Apart from the purpose of learning website building skills, this website intends to analyze the wildlife trade from the dataset of CITES in the period of 2012-2018. <br> Through presenting the truth we hope to reveal the Inseparable relationship between luxury industry and wildlife trade，  then recall people’s awareness of protecting wildlife by consuming less luxury goods made from wild animals.
