            "The FUR FREE ALLIANCE (FFA) is an international coalition of more than 50 animal protection organizations working together to end the exploitation and killing of animals for fur. The FFA represents millions of supporters worldwide.

        <br><br>In particular, FFA focuses on the deprivation and cruelty suffered by fur-bearing animals both in wild trapping and industrial fur farming. To achieve its aims the FFA seeks to:

        <br><br>– inform the public about the substantial animal suffering caused by the fur industry

        <br>– advance legislative actions and in-depth investigations as needed

        <br>– target consumers and the fashion industry to encourage readily available alternatives

        <br>– work nationally and internationally through joint or individual campaign"

                    Our group is made of 4 students from CASA, UCL. We have the common concern on the wildlife protection. We try to explore the Inseparable relationship between luxury industry and wildlife trade through the visualization of data from CITES and the driving force behind luxury industry.

                    This website is an assignment of our course——Spatial Data Capture Storage and Analysis. Apart from the purpose of learning website building skills, this website intends to analyze the wildlife trade from the dataset of CITES in the period of 2012-2018. <br> Through presenting the truth we hope to reveal the Inseparable relationship between luxury industry and wildlife trade，  then recall people’s awareness of protecting wildlife by consuming less luxury goods made from wild animals.
